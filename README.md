# 🌍 Welcome to My GitHub! 👋
### Hi, I'm Chanmi Lee (geohealth)  

I'm an **MS Public Health Data Science student** with a **previous MS in Geography** and a strong foundation in **statistical modeling and geospatial analysis**. My work focuses on using **primary tools such as R, Python, and GIS** to analyze spatial patterns in public health, address health disparities, and improve decision-making.

I am currently **seeking an internship** at the intersection of **GIS and public health**, where I can apply my expertise in **spatial epidemiology, statistical modeling, and machine learning** to real-world public health challenges.
